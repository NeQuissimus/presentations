# Availability

## Gitolite

- Lab-hosted
- No backup strategy
- Past crashes have led to data loss

# Availability

## GitHub Enterprise

- AWS hosted
- Built-in ability for backups (local or S3)
- Amazon-managed uptime

- Smart commits (i.e. change a ticket status with keywords in commit messages)

# Features

## Gitolite

- Plain git server
- Everything beyond simple git has to be custom-built

# Features

## GitHub Enterprise

- Built-in code review tool, vastly superior to CodeCollab
- Simplified git workflow
- Ability to integrate static analysis tools into code reviews, for automated code quality reviews
- Dashboards across projects
- GitHub CLI for easier usage of git
